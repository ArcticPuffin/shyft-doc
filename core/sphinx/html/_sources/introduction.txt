What's SHyFT?
=============

SHyFT, the Statkraft Hydrologic Forecasting Toolbox, is an OpenSource hydrological toolbox created as a platform for evaluating different algorithms efficiently. We refer to SHyFT as Shyft, generally using Python class PEP 8 recommendations for a class name.

The development of Shyft was initially financed by Statkraft for the purpose of improving hydrological forecasting for
hydropower scheduling. The aim of this development is to provide a framework that provides robust and tested code that may be used in operational environments, while engaging the scientific research community to work on a common hydrologic modeling platform. Shyft has a goal to provide numerous possible solutions for hydrologic simulation, and to provide a robust API to explore the various hydrologic routines.
