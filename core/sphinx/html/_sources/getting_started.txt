Getting Started
===============

Compiling
---------

Instructions for building and compiling Shyft are available on the github wiki:

`Shyft Wiki <http://github.com/statkraft/shyft/wiki/>`_


Testing
-------

The way to test SHyFT is by running::

  $ nosetests

from the root directory (your will need the numpy and nose packages).

The test suite is not very comprehensive yet, but at least would provide indications that your installation is sane.


Installing
----------

Once you tested you SHyFT package you can install it in your system via::

    $ python setup.py install
