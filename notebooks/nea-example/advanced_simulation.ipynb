To the uninitiated, it adds quite a degree of complexity. However, once you understand the different components and paradigms of Shyft, you'll see the flexibility the API offers provides a great number of possibilities for exploring hydrologic simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, as in the first tutorial, we'll start with a `YAMLSimConfig` object and create a `ConfigSimulator`. This will get us going quickly and provide a `region_model` as a starting point. But in this tutorial, the point is to work more closely with different components of the `Shyft.api`. In particular, we hope to demonstrate how the underlying `region_model`, rather than a `simulator`, is developed. The latter is just a wrapper that is made for convenience when running models operationally. If one is interested in working with Shyft to explore algorithm performance, it is easier to work directly with the `region_model` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API approach will take a bit more code to get started, but will allow great flexibility later on. The first thing we'll do is to expose several of the attributes (which are mostly Shyft API classes) of the `simulator` object. Let's begin by getting those in our namespace:"

One could have any kind of storage format for the source data. [Repositories](repositories.rst) are Python based interfaces to data. Several have been created within Shyft already, but users are encouraged to create their own. A guiding paradigm to Shyft is that data should live as close to the source as possible (ideally, at the source). The repositories connect to the data source and make the data available to Shyft."

    "We have now explored the `region_model` and looked at how to instantiate a `region_model` by using a `api.ARegionEnvironment`, containing a collection of timeseries sources, and passing an `api.InterpolationParameter` class containing the parameters to use for the data interpolation algorithms. The interpolation step \"populated\" our cells with data from the point sources.\n",

In future tutorials we'll work with the cells indivdual \"resource collector\" (`.rc`) and \"state collector\" (`.sc`) attributes.\n",
